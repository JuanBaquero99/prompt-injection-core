# Advanced Controls and Integration Plan

This document integrates security measures, advanced controls, and the integration plan for the project.

## Prioritized Measures for Future Development

1. **Isolate system instructions and mark untrusted sources**
2. **Enforce structured formats (and validate them)**
3. **Input/output filtering and content firewall**
4. **Least privilege and controlled tool-use**
5. **Safe ingestion/navigation (RAG/Agents)**
6. **External verification (LLM-as-a-Judge/rules)**
7. **Prompt hardening (assuming it may fail)**
8. **Observability and adversarial testing**
9. **Fail-closed for dangerous actions**
10. **Recommended architecture (summary)**

## Additional Controls

- Role separation in LLMs
- Controlled context size
- Defensive randomization
- Adversarial semantic analysis
- Blacklists and whitelists for actions
- Real-time secret scanning
- Execution time and frequency limits
- Controlled degraded response

## Controls Integration Plan

1. **Trained model integration**
   - Export the trained model and create the ML detector.
   - Update `PromptScanner` to allow selecting ML or rule-based detector.
   - Add automated tests in `tests/` to validate integration.

2. **Advanced controls implementation**
   - Prioritize controls by ease and impact.
   - Implement each control as a function or class in a new module.
   - Document each control in code and in this document.
   - Add unit tests for each control.

3. **Adversarial testing and continuous validation**
   - Create scripts/notebooks for adversarial testing.
   - Automate periodic system validation.
   - Update threat and pipeline documentation with new findings.

4. **Deployment and monitoring**
   - Prepare scripts for CI/CD pipeline integration.
   - Add monitoring for logs and security metrics.
   - Document deployment process and recommendations.

**Summary:**
First, train and validate with real data to obtain metrics and adjust detection. Then, implement prioritized advanced controls according to impact and ease of integration. Keep documentation updated to guide development.
