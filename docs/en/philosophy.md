# Project Philosophy: prompt-injection-core

## Context

AI system security is an emerging and critical field. This project focuses on Phase 1 of the threat lifecycle: **Input and data manipulation**. This is where attacks like Prompt Injection occur, potentially compromising the integrity and confidentiality of language models.

## Purpose

- Provide tools to detect and ethically exploit Prompt Injection vulnerabilities.
- Facilitate model evaluation under recognized frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS and OWASP AI Security.
- Serve as a foundation for developing tools in later phases of the AI threat lifecycle.

## Approach

- **Detection:** Identify possible entry points and vulnerabilities in prompts.
- **Ethical attack:** Generate attack examples for robustness testing and validation.
- **Reporting:** Document findings in alignment with industry standards.

## Relation to MITRE ATLAS and OWASP AI Security

- **MITRE ATLAS:** The project implements input manipulation techniques and tactics described in ATLAS.
- **OWASP AI Security:** Focuses on validation and sanitization of input data, covering the first phase of the threat lifecycle.

## Future Vision

- Expand coverage to other phases and attack types.
- Integrate with secure development pipelines and CI/CD.
- Generate automatic reports and mitigation recommendations.
